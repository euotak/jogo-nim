## How to Play NIM

NIM is a two-player strategy game in which players remove pieces from a set of objects. The player who removes the last piece loses the game.

## Game rules:

* **Objective:** Remove the last piece from the board.
* **Number of players:** 2.
* **Materials:**
    * Pieces (you can use any small objects, such as coins, sticks, or beans).
    * Board (optional, you can draw it on the ground or on a piece of paper).

## How to play:

* **Starting:**
    * Decide who starts (you can draw lots or the player with the smallest hand starts).
    * The starting player decides how many pieces to remove from a single pile.
    * The other player takes their turn, choosing how many pieces to remove from a single pile.
    * Players alternate turns until all pieces are removed.

* **Rules:**
    * On each turn, a player can remove any number of pieces from a single pile.
    * It is not allowed to remove pieces from multiple piles in the same turn.
    * The player who removes the last piece loses the game.

## Tips for winning:

* Pay attention to the number of pieces in each pile.
* Try to leave your opponent with a pile with a number of pieces that is a multiple of (m+1), where m is the maximum number of pieces that can be removed in a single turn.
* If you cannot leave your opponent with a pile with a number of pieces that is a multiple of (m+1), remove as many pieces as possible.

## Example game:

Player 1: Removes 2 pieces from the pile with 5 pieces.

Player 2: Removes 3 pieces from the pile with 4 pieces.

Player 1: Removes 1 piece from the pile with 2 pieces.

Player 2: Removes the last piece from the pile with 1 piece.

Result: Player 2 wins the game.

## Game variations:

* **NIM with multiple piles:** Start with multiple piles of pieces. Players can remove pieces from any pile on their turn.
* **NIM with a piece limit:** Limit the number of pieces that can be removed in a single turn.
* **NIM with special pieces:** Add special pieces to the game with unique abilities.
